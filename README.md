# Memory Card

A project from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-react-new-memory-card)

- Fetch 10 cards
- Add those 10 cards into an array
- Traverse that array and re-enter the cards with that array in another order (randomly)
- If the selected card is different from the last one, gives the user one point, if is not, restart the game
